The choice of motor for the rotating stage is detailed below

 A good option would be to use a stepper motor with a rotary encoder.

Stepper motors are known for their precision and ability to move in small increments, which makes them ideal for positioning applications like a rotating stage. The rotary encoder, on the other hand, provides feedback on the position of the motor shaft and can measure the angular position of the rotating stage at any given time.

The combination of a stepper motor and a rotary encoder allows for accurate and precise control of the rotating stage's position, making it easy to program and automate movements. A closed-loop stepper motor is a good choice since it has an integrated encoder, which provides feedback to the motor controller, allowing it to adjust the motor's position in real-time.
